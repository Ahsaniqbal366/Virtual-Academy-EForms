<!--
* We're using a seemingly usless wrapper div around the [.course-catalog-image-wrapper]
element, but it's purpose is to keep the [.promo-video-play-button]
element looking good on the image/button hover event.

* Without this empty wrapper div the play button can appear as too
large in some cases.-->
